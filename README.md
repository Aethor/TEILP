## TEILP: Time Prediction over Knowledge Graphs via Logical Reasoning
This repository contains the code for the paper [TEILP: Time Prediction over Knowledge Graphs via Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15816.pdf).

This is a follow-up wwork of [TILP: Differentiable Learning of Temporal Logical Rules on Knowledge Graphs](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=_X12NmQKvX). We convert TKGs into a temporal event knowledge graph (TEKG) which equips us to develop a differentiable random walk approach. We also introduce conditional probability density functions, associated with the logical rules involving the query interval, using which we arrive at the time prediction.
